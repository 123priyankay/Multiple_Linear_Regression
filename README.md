# Multiple_Linear_Regression
Applied MLR on Revenue Generation Data 
 Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) in machine learning is basically used to model and understand
 how multiple independent variables collectively influence a dependent variable.
 Here, I have taken Revenue genration dataset of transportation which contains 3 independent columns &
 one target columns i.e Revenue. We need to find which out of the three (X) i.e independent columns are 
 important using basic EDA, Multicollinearity, Heatmap, autocorelation,etc
